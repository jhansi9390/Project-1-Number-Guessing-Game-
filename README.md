# Project-1-Number-Guessing-Game-

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python-based console application designed for beginners. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback — whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

The game also keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it once the user correctly guesses the number. This project is great for learning the basics of:

Python syntax

Loops and conditionals
Random number generation
Input/output handling
Error handling (optional)

It’s a fun and educational project that helps reinforce programming fundamentals
